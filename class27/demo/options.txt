How do we redeploy (incorporate further changes)?
=====
1. rm -r directory that project is in
2. re clone
3. change db.js


Not great, but also works
=====
1. gitignore your db.js
2. recreate it everytime on server (if there are changes to it)
3. otherwise just git pull

Want to not do 3 steps? And just do 1?
=====
for db.js (permanently)

1. set an environment variable before you run (will be NODE_ENV)
2. process.env.NODE_ENV
3. if ^^^ == develeopment... then use localhost without password
4. otherwise... require...
5. NODE_ENV=productiong`
